From: Catherine Wong

Hi Tom,

I've attached the final paper for my project, an implementation proposal for a system with working and reconstructive memory.

Thanks again for a truly fantastic class -- it's been really one of the most thought provoking and transformative of my time at Stanford, and I'm only sorry not to have discovered it sooner (though it was a great way to ring out the years here.) Hope to stay in touch.

Best,
Cathy

Hi Prof Dean, 

I just wanted to say thanks for a great class. I didn't come into CS379c with much background, but I've learned so much over the past ten weeks. I really appreciated you sharing your life story yesterday -- it was one of the most mesmerizing and incredible I've ever heard, and truly inspirational. 

Also thanks for sharing the donkey cart analogy -- I got a good laugh out of that. 

Best, 
Maurice

Hi Tom,

Thank you so much for your helpful and encouraging feedback. This class has been a great experience: it has been very enjoyable to hear from all the different speakers, and to learn from their different perspectives, research, and experiences. We’d also like to express appreciation for how dedicated of a teacher you have been -- we are grateful for how thorough and prompt your feedback has been, and also for all the new ideas you’ve introduced us to. Also, thank you for sharing your wisdom and inspiring personal story during the last day of class. I know I’ll be remembering your thoughts about sacrifice and happiness for a long, long time. 

We’ve attached our final paper here. If it can help future students in the class, we’re very happy to have it shared. Also, we’re looking forward to reading your report on the course! 

Again, thanks for everything! This has truly been an inspirational course!

All the best,
Lucy, Marcus, Michelle, Nate and Rohun

Hi Tom,

Sorry about the late submission, and thank you again for the great class this quarter! Attached here is our final project paper for the course, which also links to our Github code repo. 

As undergraduate sophomores in math and biology respectively, neither of us had much prior experience with interdisciplinary machine learning work, and this class was a great opportunity to gain experience with it in the fascinating context of neuroscience. We really enjoyed the presentations and speakers; thank you for putting this together!

Best,

Eric and Zheng

From: Rooz Mahdavian

Hi Tom,

Sincere apologies for the delay on this, our final version is attached! We truly hope it’s not too late. As it’s our last paper as undergrads at Stanford, we really wanted to get it right, and would love to hear your feedback if at all possible. 

In either case, I also wanted to thank you for putting such a unique course together -- it brought together so much of what I’ve been personally thinking about since I arrived here, and was a great send off for my undergraduate experience.

Best,
Rooz Mahdavian

From: Nate Tyler Stockham

Hi Tom,

I've attached a pdf with our work thus far on the project. Were still interested in it and plan to continue working on it, and would be glad to send you updates. The github repo is referenced in the paper, though it is kind of a mess right now. Thank you again so much for the extension, and thank you for a wonderful course! 

Best,
Nate
