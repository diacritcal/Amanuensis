\section{Bootstrapped Linguistic Competence}

%%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this appendix, we consider how we might design an end-to-end training protocol for bootstrapping a variant of the programmer's apprentice application. We begin with the analogous stages in early child development. Each of the following four stages is briefly introduced with additional technical details provided in the accompanying footnotes:
%
\begin{itemize}
%
\item Basic cognitive bootstrapping and linguistic grounding\footnote{\input{./inputs/footnotes/A_grounding.tex}}: %%% Objective_A_Mastery_of_Basic_Referential_Modes.rtf
%
  \begin{itemize}
%
  \item modeling language: statistical $n$-gram language model trained on programming corpus;
%
  \item hierarchical planning: automated tutor generates lessons using curriculum training;
%
  \end{itemize}
%
\item Simple interactive behavior for signaling and editing\footnote{\input{./inputs/footnotes/B_signaling.tex}}: %%% Objective_B_Following_and_Confirming_References.rtf
%
  \begin{itemize}
%
  \item following instruction: learning to carry out simple plans one instruction at a time;
%
  \item explaining behavior: providing short explanations of behavior, acknowledging failure;
%
  \end{itemize}
%
\item Mixed dialogue interleaving instruction and mirroring\footnote{\input{./inputs/footnotes/C_mirroring.tex}}: %%% Objective_C_Decomposing_Collaborative_Dialogue.rtf
%
  \begin{itemize}
%
  \item classifying intention: learning to categorize tasks and summarize intentions to act;
%
  \item confirming comprehension: conveying practical understanding of specific instructions;
%
  \end{itemize}
%
\item Composite behaviors corresponding to simple repairs\footnote{\input{./inputs/footnotes/D_combining.tex}}: %%% Objective_D_Combining_Actions_to_Effect_Repairs.rtf
%
  \begin{itemize}
%
  \item executing complex plans: generating and executing multi-step plans with contingencies;
%
  \item recovering from failure: backtracking, recovering, retracting steps on failed branches;
%
  \end{itemize}
%
\end{itemize}
